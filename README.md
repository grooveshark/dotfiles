GS standard dotfiles

.gitconfig should go in your home folder. Make sure to edit name and url to be yours!

.gitignore should go in any new project

.vimrc should go in your home folder. If you are an avid vim user with your own complex vimrc you *must* include all of the directives from here in yours.

bookmarklets.js contains useful JS snippets for working with bugzilla and github. You'll have to make a separate bookmarklet for each line obviously.
